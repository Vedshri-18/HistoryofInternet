            <p>The history of the Internet has its origin in the efforts to build and interconnect computer networks that arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.</p>
            <p>In Oct 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik1 Satellite and the first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the Department of Defence, United States of America. The very first Computer was large in size and not intended for Communication. </p>
            <p>Still, the first practical schematics for the internet would not arrive until the early 1960s, when MIT’s J.C.R. Licklider popularized the idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers. Shortly thereafter, computer scientists developed the concept of “packet switching,” a method for effectively transmitting electronic data that would later become one of the major building blocks of the internet.</p>
            <p>In 1962, there was an idea that shows network communication be built but it almost took 7 years to implement it. In 1969, they implemented the network concept and the same year first human landing on moon happened.</p>
            <p>In 1969, Larry Roberts started working on “Interface Message Processor (IMP)” which was a packet switching node used to interconnect networks. BBN team lead by Frank Heart began working on connecting 4 IMPs. There was an issue as the packets were not stopping after delivering message to node. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each one was the size of a small house). In 1971, there were 18 main frame computers connected to network. </p>

            <p>ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks.</p>
            <p>In June 1992, Congress passed a bill to make Internet public and from there internet commercially available to public. Before that internet was only used by the defence department.</p>
            <p>In 1993, Mosaic web browser was created by two students from University of Illinois. Mosaic was the first web that popularized the World Wide Web and the Internet.</p>
            <p>In 21st Century, Internet is everything. There are 11 million Domain names and 70 million websites over internet and it’s still counting.</p>
