            <p>Internet, not only became used for search or trade or business, but also became a medium of communication. One can give an example of Facebook. New age firms made the web into a two-way medium, which is controlled by none, and owned and shaped by everyone. It is undeniable truth that the world, humans have shaped and reshaped and changed the Internet, but currently, the web has changed the world drastically. A new word highlighted, Social. With the generated skills of the Internet, Social Networking came up. Communication can be made by a phone or a letter or any other. It was then proven, that the Internet can be used to communicate and share information at a social level.</p>
            <p>To elaborate, Internet has shaped human lives in a very different way. New inventions and new technologies were made possible using the services and facilities provided by the Internet. Convenience became a necessity with this. </p>
            <p>Internet is considered to be messenger, a messenger of knowledge and information regardless of the country or area. A click sound makes one go through unimaginable and uncountable records of information. It can be said that, the Internet is an invention which has the potential to shape the future of this planet in the best way possible.</p>
            <p>Well, talking about 2.0 Insurgency, H. K. Rose and J. Adelson are among the pioneers of this concept. Before being sold to Google, the three founders collectively had uploaded an initial video in YouTube, just to test it. Nobody actually knew that his idea will shoot up well. One can still find video which was filmed in a zoo. Eventually, YouTube was bought by Google in around 2005. Just to explain it normally, YouTube is a platform for sharing videos which was created by three professionals and then sold to Google for millions of dollars. Well, Google genuinely saw the potential of this idea, as not everything can be understood by an instruction manual. A video tutorial can help one create a better thing rather than just reading about it.</p>
            <p>YouTube posed like a power given to netizens, where everybody can learn, see and explore anything they can think of. Baking a cake, current world news, technological updates, education and much more can be learned from this application of the Internet.</p>
